Hello and welcome! I am currently entering my third year as an Undergraduate student in Aerospace Engineering at The Pennsylvania State University. I am doing research under Dr. Geng with the Aerial Robotics and Interaction (ARI) Laboratory which I joined in the summer of 2024.

My research area focuses on path planning and optimization of an unmanned aerial vehicle. I am interested in developing advanced algorithms to improve the design and function of aerial manipulators.

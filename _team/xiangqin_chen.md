Hello! My name is Xiangqin Chen, and I'm an undergraduate student at Pennsylvania State University, where I'm pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics. I have a keen interest in computer graphics/vision, machine learning, and its hardware foundations. Robotics perfectly combines both, bringing me to this Aerial Robots and interaction lab.

My research primarily focuses on 3D reconstruction using sensors deployed on aerial robots, such as image sensors and LiDAR. The ultimate goal is to achieve a processing pipeline to generate a real-time and accuracy-optimized 3D map. This involves leveraging advanced mathematical techniques and complex optimization models to create highly accurate 3D maps, all while being constrained by limited hardware resources like GPU and CPU.

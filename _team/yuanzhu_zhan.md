Welcome! I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Aerospace Engineering at Pennsylvania State University, advised by Prof. Junyi Geng. I joined aerial robots and interaction (ARI) laboratory in 24 fall. Before that, I received my Bachelor's degree at Nankai University in 2024. 

My research interests lie in various aspects of aerial robots. The long term objective is closing the perception, planning, and control loop of aerial robotics. I am working to push the boundary of the autonomy of aerial robotics.

In my spare time, I am also a model plane amateur. Design and test different types of airplane is always attractive for me.

I am a Master's student in Aerospace Engineering currently working with Prof. Geng since Spring 2023. I hold a B.Sc. in Aerospace Engineering obtained in December 2023. My primary interests lie in aerial robotics and the application of data-driven modeling and optimal control to nonlinear dynamical systems, utilizing operator-theoretic methods. I am dedicated to exploring the practical applications of these approaches for enhancing the capabilities of aerial robots.

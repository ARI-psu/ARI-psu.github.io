Dr. Geng is an [Assistant Professor](https://www.aero.psu.edu/department/directory-detail-g.aspx?q=jxg1052) with [Deparment of Aerospace Engineering](https://www.aero.psu.edu/) at [Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/). She was a Postdoc Fellow with the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), where she was a member of [AirLab](https://theairlab.org/) working on aerial manipulation and eVTOL. Before that, Jenny was a Postdoc researcher of [Coordinated Science Lab](https://csl.illinois.edu/) at [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) working on robotic manipulation for high precision assembly. She received her Ph.D. and M.S. in [Aerospace Engineering](https://www.aero.psu.edu/) with a minor in [Electrical Engineering](https://www.eecs.psu.edu/) at [Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/), and my B.Eng. in Aircraft Design and Engineering at [Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics](https://studyatnuaa.org/).

Her research goal is to advance state-of-the-art aerial autonomy by bridging the aerospace and robotic communities. Her research is primarily concerned with perception and manipulation algorithms to enable high performance autonomy for aerial robots. She is enthusiastic about robotics and unmanned aerial system (UAS). She is also interested in optimization and machine learning and applying them on hardware. Jenny is a remote pilot for UAS. She loves flying drones and building robots.

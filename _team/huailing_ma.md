Hello and welcome! I am Huailing Ma, currently an intern in Aerospace Engineering at Pennsylvania State University, working under the guidance of Prof. Geng. I am conducting research at the Aerial Robots and Interaction (ARI) Laboratory from November 2024 to May 2025.

My research interests include various types of aerial drones, with a recent focus on multi-quadrotor lifting systems, where I am exploring reinforcement learning-based training methods. I am also deeply interested in control algorithms, trajectory planning, and their applications in aerial robot systems.

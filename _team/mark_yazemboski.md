Hello! I’m Mark Yazemboski, a first-year Master’s student in Aerospace Engineering at Pennsylvania State University, advised by Prof. Junyi Geng. I also completed my Bachelor’s degree in Aerospace Engineering at Penn State.
I am passionate about aerospace autonomy, control, and the modeling of dynamic systems. My research focuses on modeling complex contact forces, along with aerodynamic interactions, to further understand how to control robots that interact with objects.
In my free time, I enjoy working on various robotics and GNC projects, as well as playing tennis.

Hello! I am a graduate student in aerospace engineering at Penn State University where I also completed my undergraduate degree. Under the supervision of Dr. Langelaan in the Air Vehicle Intelligence and Autonomy (AVIA) Lab, I developed my undergraduate thesis: "Collision Avoidance of Dynamic Obstacles Using a Potential Flow Theory Approach". I am excited to continue working with Dr. Langelaan in collaboration with Dr. Geng in the ARI Lab as I embark on my graduate research journey!

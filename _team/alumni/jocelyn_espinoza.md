Hi! My name is Jocelyn Espinoza, and I am a senior at Penn State majoring in Aerospace Engineering with a minor in Mathematics Applications. This summer I joined the ARI lab, and with the guidance of Dr. Geng, I’m investigating a coordinated system of drones that is capable of transporting a payload. I am very excited to work with everyone in the lab and learn more about drones!

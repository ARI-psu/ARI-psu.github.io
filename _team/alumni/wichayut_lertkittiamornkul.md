Hello! I am Wichayut but you can also call me Earth. I'm currently a senior undergraduate student majoring in Aerospace Engineering at Penn State and joined the ARI lab in the Spring of 2025.

My research interest is in agile quadrotor flight using model predictive control. My main goal is to create an MPC controller and deploy it on hardware to achieve agile flight of quadrotors!

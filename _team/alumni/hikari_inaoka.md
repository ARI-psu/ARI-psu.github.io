Hello, my name is Hikari and I am a fourth year majoring in mechanical engineering with a minor in geosciences. I joined ARI in March of 2024 and currently working on my senior thesis research, which revolves around modeling an actuated robot manipulator in a simulated environment. My hobbies outside of the classroom include biking, grabbing boba with friends, and planespotting at the local airport.

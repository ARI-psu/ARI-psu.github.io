Hello and welcome! I'm a recent graduate from Pennsylvania State University, where I earned dual degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics. I've been fascinated by the world of robotics and machine learning, which led me to my current position at the Aerial Robots and Interaction (ARI) Laboratory, under the guidance of Dr. Geng.

My primary research at the ARI Lab centers on Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control for robotic systems. I'm particularly drawn to the challenge of applying advanced computational methods to optimize robotic control. Simultaneously, I'm diving deep into machine learning and its myriad applications, continually intrigued by its potential to transform our understanding and use of robotics.

Hello and welcome to my page! I am currently an Undergraduate student in Aerospace Engineering at Pennsylvania State University going into my fourth year. I am currently doing research under Dr. Geng and joined aerial robots and interaction (ARI) laboratory at the start of the 2023 summer.  

My research area focuses on design optimization of an aerial manipulator. I am interested in engineering design and the integration of machine learning with engineering.

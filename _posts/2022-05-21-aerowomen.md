A diverse and inclusive working and learning environment fosters the understanding, communication, respect, and collaboration. I believe a high quality university education has the power to help close the gaps that separate communities due to disparities in opportunity and access. Throughout my academic
career, I found that my graduate school and postdoctoral experiences was enriched by the diverse pool of people from a great variety of countries and cultures, and from different underrepresented groups. As a woman in STEM, I consider myself to be contributing to the cultural diversity based on my
experiences.

## Services
I believe that women and minorities can achieve excellence in the fields where they are traditionally underrepresented. I have aimed to improve the diversity, equality, and inclusion in aerospace engineering, a major typically dominated by males. 

* I have served in the Penn State AeroWomen group, which provided opportunities for members to network with faculty, alumni, and industry personnel and to develop academic and professional skills. 
* I have organized various activities targeted at the female engineering students. 
  * I have organized and hosted the first AeroWomen networking event with aerospace recruiters and alumni during career fair week, 
  * I have organized the movie night showing the biography stories of successful women, helped organize the ice cream social and hiking event, etc. 



## Involvement
I believe that if there is more communication, understanding and involvement, the situation that women are rated as less dominant and less trustworthy will be improved. I have actively been involved into diversity-themed activities outside Penn State to enrich myself and contribute to the diversity. 

* I have been invited to join the 2019 Women in Aerospace Symposium hosted in MIT Aeronautics and Astronautics Department. 
* I have been invited to join 2021 Rising Star in Aerospace Workshop hosted in MIT Aeronautics and Astronautics Department.

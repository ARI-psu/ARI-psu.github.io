Trajectory planning in robotics aims to generate collision-free pose sequences that can be reliably executed. Recently, vision-to-planning systems have garnered increasing attention for their efficiency and ability to interpret and adapt to surrounding environments. However, traditional modular systems suffer from increased latency and error propagation, while purely data-driven approaches often overlook the robot's kinematic constraints. This oversight leads to discrepancies between planned trajectories and those that are executable. To address these challenges, we propose iKap, a novel vision-to-planning system that integrates the robot's kinematic model directly into the learning pipeline. iKap employs a self-supervised learning approach and incorporates the state transition model within a differentiable bi-level optimization framework. This integration ensures the network learns collision-free waypoints while satisfying kinematic constraints, enabling gradient back-propagation for end-to-end training. Our experimental results demonstrate that iKap achieves higher success rates and reduced latency compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Besides the complete system, iKap offers a visual-to-planning network that seamlessly integrates kinematics into various controllers, providing a robust solution for robots navigating complex and dynamic environments.

## Method Overview

iKap is trained based on bi-level optimization. In this framework, the networks, generate waypoints based on the given depth perception and goals. Then, the low-level trajectory optimization module tracks a kinematics-feasible trajectory. The embedded kinematics and gradients from the lower-level module are then utilized to supervise and train the networks.
